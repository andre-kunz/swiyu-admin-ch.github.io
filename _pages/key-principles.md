# Swiss e-ID - Key Principles defined by law

The Swiss Trust Infrastructure is built on top of the following key principles to protect e-ID users defined in Art. 1 of the BGEID:

- **Privacy by Design**: The system incorporates technical and organizational measures to minimize data processing risks and ensure that privacy is embedded into the infrastructure by default (Art. 1, Sec. 2, (a), 1).
- **Data Security**: Rigorous measures are taken to secure data, protecting it against unauthorized access or misuse, and ensuring the safety of electronic credentials during their entire lifecycle (Art. 1, Sec. 2, (a), 2).
- **Data Minimization**: Only the minimum data necessary for each purpose is processed or shared, reducing unnecessary exposure of user information (Art. 1, Sec. 2, (a), 3).
- **Decentralized Data Storage**: User data is stored in a decentralized manner, typically on the holder's device, to prevent centralized data accumulation and reduce the risks of large-scale breaches (Art. 1, Sec. 2, (a), 4).
- **Accessibility**: The E-ID infrastructure aligns with modern technical standards and is accessible to individuals with disabilities, ensuring inclusivity and compatibility across systems (Art. 1, Sec. 2, (c)).
- **Support for Innovation**: The law ensures the infrastructure supports future technological advancements and does not impose unnecessary restrictions on technical evolution (Art. 1, Sec. 2, (d))â€‹
