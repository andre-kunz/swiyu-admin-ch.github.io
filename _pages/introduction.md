The [Federal Act on Electronic Identity and Other Electronic Credentials (BGEID)](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/fga/2025/20/) that was adopted by the Council of States and the National Council on December 20th 2024 sets the foundation for the establishment of the Swiss Trust Infrastructure.

## Key Principles

The Swiss Trust Infrastructure is built on top of the following key principles to protect e-ID users defined in Art. 1 of the BGEID:

- **Privacy by Design**: The system incorporates technical and organizational measures to minimize data processing risks and ensure that privacy is embedded into the infrastructure by default (Art. 1, Sec. 2, (a), 1).
- **Data Security**: Rigorous measures are taken to secure data, protecting it against unauthorized access or misuse, and ensuring the safety of electronic credentials during their entire lifecycle (Art. 1, Sec. 2, (a), 2).
- **Data Minimization**: Only the minimum data necessary for each purpose is processed or shared, reducing unnecessary exposure of user information (Art. 1, Sec. 2, (a), 3).
- **Decentralized Data Storage**: User data is stored in a decentralized manner, typically on the holder's device, to prevent centralized data accumulation and reduce the risks of large-scale breaches (Art. 1, Sec. 2, (a), 4).
- **Accessibility**: The E-ID infrastructure aligns with modern technical standards and is accessible to individuals with disabilities, ensuring inclusivity and compatibility across systems (Art. 1, Sec. 2, (c)).
- **Support for Innovation**: The law ensures the infrastructure supports future technological advancements and does not impose unnecessary restrictions on technical evolution (Art. 1, Sec. 2, (d))​

## Ambition Levels

There are 3 levels of ambition defined to distinguish the levels of ecosystem development envisioned for the Swiss Trust Infrastructure. These levels differentiate themselves predominantly by the type of issuers that participate in the Swiss Trust Infrastructure. These ambition levels can develop next to each other and do not necessarily imply a hierarchical dependency. Still level 2 and 3 are largely dependent on the technical foundations and trust infrastructure provided in Ambition level 1.

### Ambition Level 1: Basic e-ID

At this foundational level, the  e-ID is issued as a digital credential to Swiss nationals, citizens and residents, who then are referred to as holders. Those holders receive, store and present their e-ID via the digital wallet they have installed on their smart phone. An identity wallet is provided by the Swiss Government (SWIYU link).

At this level, the e-ID credential can be used both in the public- and private sector for a wide range of foundational use cases that require secure and trustworthy digital identification and authentication e.g. for services like opening a bank account or subscribing to mobile services.

### Ambition Level 2: Public Sector Issuance

At this level, the Swiss public sector is moving beyond adopting the Swiss Trust Infrastructure for identity verification and authentication by issuing a broad range of public sector credentials such as electronic driving licenses or residence certificates.

With the additionally available credentials issued by the public sector, it becomes possible to address more complex use cases. For example, when two credentials such as the e-ID and a proof of residence issued by the municipality have to be presented in combination to proof ones eligibility for a specific service both in the private and public sector.   

### Ambition Level 3: Private Sector Issuance

At this level, the private sector is actively adopting the Swiss Trust Infrastructure beyond consuming identity credentials and proofs but also contributes to the availability of other credentials by issuing other kinds of digital credentials. These can range from proof of insurance over employee credentials all the way to membership cards and event tickets, all made available via the Swiss Trust Infrastructure to the Identity Wallets. 

With the additional identity credentials available via the private sector, even more complex use cases are enabled on the verification side, allowing for a combination of private and public source identity credentials and proofs to be combined in identity interactions.
