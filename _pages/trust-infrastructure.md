### Issuer

But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. 

Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?

At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui blanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati cupiditate non provident, similique sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollitia animi, id est laborum et dolorum fuga. Et harum quidem rerum facilis est et expedita distinctio. Nam libero tempore, cum soluta nobis est eligendi optio cumque nihil impedit quo minus id quod maxime placeat facere possimus, omnis voluptas assumenda est, omnis dolor repellendus. Temporibus autem quibusdam et aut officiis debitis aut rerum necessitatibus saepe eveniet ut et voluptates repudiandae sint et molestiae non recusandae. Itaque earum rerum hic tenetur a sapiente delectus, ut aut reiciendis voluptatibus maiores alias consequatur aut perferendis doloribus asperiores repellat.

### Registries
#### Base registry

On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.

sire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided.

### User Story 1: As an Issuer, I want to trust the Wallet I interact with. 

Issuers want to trust that Wallets they interact with adhere to protocol standards and are capable of securely handling and verifying issued credentials will have a technical means to do so. In the Swiss Trust Infrastructure, this trust is enabled by cryptographic verification of the wallet (Key attestation) or by other Recognition Processes (to be defined). One example for such a trusted Wallet is the Federally provided open-source SWIYU Wallet.  

### User Story 2: As a Verifier, I want to trust the Issuer 

Verifiers want to trust the Issuers of Credentials they request and will have the technological means to do so. Utilizing both, the Base registry and the Trust registry, verifiers can make their own assessment on whether the issuer is a trustworthy party to issue the credential(s) under consideration. Trust into the registries is further built on Trust Registry onboarding processes, that provide an initial quality gate for parties to even enter into the Swiss Trust Infrastructure at a trustworthy level. 

### User Story 3: As a Holder, I want to trust the Issuer 

Holders trust Issuers based on the accuracy of their entry in the Trust registry and their own assessment on whether the issuer is a trustworthy party to issue the credential under consideration. Trust is further utilizing Trust Registry onboarding processes, that provide an initial quality gate for parties to even enter the ecosystem. 

### User Story 4: As a Holder I want to trust the Verifier 

Holders trust Verifiers based on the accuracy of their entry in the Trust registry and their own assessment on whether the verifier is a trustworthy party to share the personal data being requested. This trust is also built on Trust Registry onboarding processes, that provide an initial quality gate for parties to even enter the ecosystem. Individually holders expect that Verifiers will respect privacy and use credentials appropriately.
