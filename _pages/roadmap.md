## Public Beta

The Public Beta environment aims to function as a basis for integration and experimentation efforts conducted by the ecosystem participants from both the public sector and the private sector. It provides the same technology that will be provided by the productive environment in 2026. It's operation and support are run on a best effort basis and is planned to be available beyond the full production roll out in 2026 as an integration environment. 

## Pre-Release environment

The Pre-Release environment will be utilized for selected business cases to be already brought into production in 2025, both from federal participants, and 3rd parties. These business cases need to be independent from the e-ID credential that will be made available in the Trust Infrastructure in 2026 only. Such a credential is for example the eLFAâ€¯ (elektronischer Lernfahrausweis or electronic learner's driving licence) credential that is planned to be launched on the Pre-Release environment. The Pre-Release system will gradually be transitioned into becoming the productive environment. It is thus treated with the scrutiny of a productive environment from the start.
