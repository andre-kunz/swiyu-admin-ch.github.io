# swiyu-admin-ch.github.io
Technical documentation repository for the swiyu Public Beta Trust Infrastructure

## Overview

The aim of this repository is to provide a technical overview, deeper insights on standards and protocols as well as cookbooks for the onboarding to the different components of the swiyu Public Beta Trust Infrastructure. The content in this repository will be automatically published on the [swiyu documentation website](https://swiyu-admin-ch.github.io/). The website offers better user guidance and additional features compared to the Git Hub repository. 

The structure of the documentation website covers the following topics: 
- Overview of the Swiss Trust Infrastructure
- Selected base technologies and supported technical standards
- Open Source components: Overview and links to the code repositories
- Cookbooks for onboarding the different stakeholders
- Specifications of the "Swiss Profile", Trust Protocol, and other standards

## Public Beta

All documentation is related to the Public Beta environment. As soon as we'll have different versions e.g. for Public Beta and the Pre-release environment, the versions will be marked. Please note that operation and support of the Public Beta environment are run on a best effort basis.

## Basic repository structure 

The structure of the repository is different from the website.  

- **_cookbooks**: The cookbooks are a collection of markdown files you'll find in this folder.
- **_data**: In this folder you'll find the basic navigation as well as all translations for the user interface
- **_pages**: Most of the webpages are markdown files in the _pages folder.
- **_posts**: All Changelog posts are markdown files in the _posts folder.
- **_specifications**: Specific specifications and implementations for the swiyu Public Beta Trust Infrastructure
- **assets**: All relevant assets for the website, e.g. images for the general appearance and cookbooks, are placed in sub-folders
