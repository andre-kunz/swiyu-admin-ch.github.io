# swiyu-admin-ch.github.io
Documentation repository for swiyu - the Swiss e-ID trust infrastructure

## Overview

The aim of this repository is to provide a technical overview, deeper insights on standards and protocols as well as cookbooks for the onboarding to the different components of the Swiss e-ID trust infrastructure. The content in this repository will be automatically published on the [swiyu documentation website](https://swiyu-admin-ch.github.io/). 

The structure of the documentation website covers the following topics: 
- Introduction, key principles and ambition levels
- Overview of the Swiss Trust Infrastructure
- Selected base technologies and supported technical standards
- Cookbooks for onboarding the different stakeholders
- Notes on Security & Privacy

## Public Beta

All documentation is related to the Public Beta environment. As soon as we'll have different versions e.g. for Public Beta and the Pre-release environment, the versions will be marked. Please note that operation and support of the Public Beta environment are run on a best effort basis.

## Contributions and feedback

Contributions are welcome via GitHub Issues and GitHub pull requests. Before opening an issue or pull request, please check whether a ticket already exists that describes your intention. The development of Public Beta is taking place within a tight timeframe. We do our best to respond to your feedback as quickly as possible.
